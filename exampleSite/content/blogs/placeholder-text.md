## Introduction
I like going to the gym. There are so many different things that I can write about in the topic of gym that I cannot decide where to start. Thus, I will section this blog and write about the different aspects of gymming that I think are important. 

## Training
Currently, I am following the low volume training routine. I do about 4 to 8 sets per body part per week. Since I am doing low volume, I bring each set to failure with the addition of partial reps at the lengthened position of the muscle or assisted reps after reaching technical failure
I believe that the method of training is upto the person's priorities, life style, and what they enjoy. There is no one correct way to going to the gym. I have done a variety of volume for training, ranging from 4 sets per muscle group per week, all the way to 20+ sets per week. I have also tried the push pull leg split, the upper lower split, push pull split, and the full body split. I have also trained for strength. And I believe that enjoyment is the most important factor of training. 

## How training helped me
During the lockdown, I could barely go train due to all the gyms being closed. I had become lazy and my body was getting weaker. 

I think this was one of the factors that lead to my lower back injury in 2021 right before my miliatry service. I went to several orthopedics hospitals and Korean medical clinics for acupuncture, none which helped. Every doctor told me that weight lifting would only make it worse, so I completely stopped exercising. I joined the military with the herniated disc, worried about my future. 

During training, every person carried 40kgs on his back and went up a hill multiple times and wear a heavy bullet proof vest. This caused my pain to become so much worse and I could not even turn my body properly nor handle closing a door. Yet, when I went to the commander for accomodation, I was met with a cold reality of the military not being accomodating at all. There was no one to help me other than the pain killers that I took before training. From the weakness in my lower back, other parts of my body started getting weak too, with pain in both my right knee and my left elbow. I honestly felt miserable.

Although I was told not to lift, I decided to go to the gym within the base and do bodyweight exercises. The pain continued, but at least I could do body weight exercise again. And soon, I started to do weight training again. After my first session, I took a nap, and when I woke up, I physically could not get up. My lower back was in so much pain, that I had to roll out of the bed and pick myself up. I thought I had really messed up. 

However, the next morning, the pain was gone, and the overall pain was also somewhat reduced. Thinking that maybe this was the answer to my pain, I started training again, with very light weights and perfecting my form. Then I gradually increased my weights week by week.

And today, my lower back pain is nearly gone, and I am in the best shape of my life. But now, if I get lazy and stop exercising, the pain starts to creep in.

## What Training Means to Me
I weighed around 57kgs at 174cms when I started lifting in 2016. I peaked at 76kgs at 177cms in the past year, and now I am a healthy 70kgs at 177cms. There are many reasons why I work out. Sometimes, it helps me go through a break up. It also gives my life more of a structure, and build a routine. I also wanted to look bigger so I don't get picked on on the scary streets of Toronto. Frankly, it also boosts my confidence. 

At a point of my life, training was my number one priority. I would gym 2 hours a day, 6 time a week. After leg days, I would get a migraine for the rest of the day due to the intensity. I would down two scoops of protein every day and force fed myself a high protein, high calorie "second dinners". I would not be able to eat food if I didnt think it had 25 grams of protein in it. 

Looking back, it sounds psycotic. But at the time, this is what I loved and pursued. Now I am more moderate with my approach to training and nutrition, and I enjoy life more and work on other passions that I have!
