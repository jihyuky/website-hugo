## Introduction
I like going to the gym. There are so many different things that I can write about in the topic of gym that I cannot decide where to start. Thus, I will section this blog and write about the different aspects of gymming that I think are important. 

## Training Philosophy
Currently, I am following the school of thought of Mike Mentzer and his low volume training. I do about 4 to 8 sets per body part per week, with a bro-split style of training. Since I am doing such low volume, I bring each set to failure with the addition of partial reps at the lengthened position of the muscle or assisted reps after reaching technical failure. This method of training was first popularized by famous body builder Mike Mentzer during the 1980s, and adopted by many other greats such as Dorian Yates. It has recently been popularized again in the fitness community and an approach that I am using. It is the method that I enjoy right now.

Nevertheless, it is my belief that it is not the definitive answer to how one should train. The method of training is upto the person's priorities, life style, and most importantly, their preference. There is no one correct way to going to the gym. If one wants to do a Crossfit way of training, that is cool. If one wants to do Powerlifting, that is fine too. I have done a variety of volume for training, ranging from 4 sets per muscle group per week, all the way to 20+ sets per week. I have also tried the push pull leg split, the upper lower split, push pull split, and the full body split. I have also trained for strength. In different phases of my life, I have enjoyed those other splits and volumes, but now, I prefer the method of training that I do now. And I believe that enjoyment is the most important factor of training. 

## How Training Saved My Life
During the lockdown, I could barely go train due to all the gyms being closed. I had become lazy and my body was getting weaker. 

In the summer of 2021, I was on a trampoline with a friend, and hurt my lower back with him while attempting a back flip. I had gotten a herniated disc, and the pain was immeasurable. I could not sit down for longer than five minutes, nor stand for a long time either. I went to several orthopedics hospitals and Korean medical clinics for acupuncture, none which helped. Every doctor told me that weight lifting would only make it worse, so I completely stopped exercising. I joined the military with the herniated disc, worried about my future. 

During war simulation training, we had to carry 40kgs on my back up a hill multiple times and wear a heavy bullet proof vest. This caused my pain to become so much worse that I could not even turn my body properly nor handle closing a door. Yet, when I went to my superior for some aid, he replied, "Shouldn't you be responsible for your own part though?", meaning there was nothing he was going to do to help with my situation. There was no one to help me other than the pain killers that I took before training. From the weakness in my lower back, other parts of my body started getting infected, with my right knee starting to hurt, and my elbow joints also feeling pain. To be frank, life was miserable. I felt like I was in an eighty year old man. 

Because I missed working out so much, I decided to go to the gym within the base and do bodyweight exercises, as it wouldn't be too taxxing on the lower back. The pain continued, but at least I could do body weight exercise again. And despite what the doctors told me, I starting romanian deadlifting to strengthen my core. After returning from the gym, I took a nap, and when I woke up, I physically could not get up. My lower back was in so much pain, that I had to roll out of the bed, and pick myself up. I thought my life was over, and I had screwed up my body forever. However, the next morning, the striking pain was gone, and the overall pain was also somewhat reduced. Thinking that maybe this was the answer to my pain, I started training again, with weights less than what I used to do, but focusing on perfecting my form and being extra cautious.

And today, my lower back pain is nearly gone, and I am in the best shape of my life.

## What Training Means to Me
I weighed around 57kgs at 174cms when I started lifting in 2016. I peaked at 76kgs at 177cms in the past year, and now I am a healthy 70kgs at 177cms. There are many reasons why I work out. Sometimes, it helps me go through a break up. It also gives my life more of a structure, and build a routine. I also wanted to look bigger so I don't get picked on on the scary streets of Toronto. Frankly, it also boosts my confidence. 

In some phases of my life, training was my number one priority. I spent 2 hours at the gym for 6 days a week before. I had spent nearly all of my free time I got in the military in the gym. I downed two scoops of protein every day, and had a "second dinner" filled with protein and calories during the military. At this point, I was unable to eat food if I thought it did not have at minimum 25 grams of protein in it. I used to feel a blood vessel pop in my brain every single set during a leg day. 

I am no longer like that anymore, and writing that out, it sounds borderline psychopathic. Now I try to minimize the time in the gym, and just enjoy every single day at the gym. I can eat an occasion poutine every now and then with 0 grams of protein, and also just eat chips. But it is still something that I love.
