## Introduction
I grew up across seven countries, spending two to three years in each. This allowed me to experience the uniqueness of each culture and sprouted my love for traveling.

Over the summer, I had the opportunity to travel across Europe with my family. We visited Barcelona, Budapest, Venice, and Trieste, Prague while staying in Vienna. 

## Barcelona
My little brother (14 years old) was invited to play in the AMIS orchestra in Barcelona in April of 2023. I was so proud of him and amazed by his musical talent. My mother and I visited Barcelona to watch his concert and to tour Barcelona while we were there.

We visited the tourist destinations such as the La Sagrada Familia, Cathedral of Barcelona, Camp Nou, Gaudi Park, and many others. I resonated most with the Gaudi Park, as his usage of vibrant colors and manipulation of perception made his architecture unique and appealing.

We also tried a lot of food-- paella, suckling pig, tapas, and jamon. Everything tasted so good, but my favorite by far was the jamon. The salty, fatty piece of dry-cured piece of meat full of flavor was so good. 

We ended the trip with watching my brother playing his violin. It was endearing to watch him be so passionate about music, and to see him make new friends through practicing music.

## Budapest
We drove over to Budapest as it was only a couple hour drive from Vienna. Budapest is the first Eastern Europe country that I had been to. We drove around the city and across the bridge over the Danube River. The Fisherman's Bastion was also very pretty, and I thought it had a funny name.

The night life in Budapest was very vibrant. A lot of people were out drinking and eating late dinners. There were clubs with loud music, and even people dancing outside restaurants. It was very different from its neighbor Vienna, where there is not much night life and is quiet overall.

## Venice and Trieste
My older sister visited us from London in June, and we took a family trip to Venice and Trieste. It was our first family trip as a whole since COVID.

The day we visited Venice is when the water in Venice turned green. It was on the news before we arrived, and when we did, it was actually green. Despite that, Venice was very good. The food tasted amazing and the city itself was so different. With gondolas instead of taxis, and small little alley ways filled with people, there is no where like Venice in the world. 

## Prague
I had always heard about how beauitful Prague was but never had the opportunity to visit. We visited Prague in August, and it really was nice. The above photo is a photo of my brother and me in Prague. The Prague Castle, Old Town Square, and the Jewish Quarter were all very pretty. The most memorable experience was walking across the Charles Bridge and eating Trdeln√≠k (chimney cake) filled with cream, choclate, and strawberries.
