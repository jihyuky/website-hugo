Military was a special experience. It was tough and challenging, but I also have fond memories. 

Through enduring suffering, I came out stronger. It built me resillience, discipline, teamwork, leadership, dealing with others with a very different background, and the balance between keeping quiet and following orders and also speaking out.

Although I never want to go through it again, I am so glad that I went through it.

## Random stories

Winter training:

In the Korean military, we have a training called HokHanGi. It takes place during the coldest week of winter, and we suffer through it. We have a saying in Korea, where during summer training, we think, "I want to die" due to the humidity and heat, but during winter training, we think, "I want to live", because it is so cold that we feel like we could die.

During training, our base camped out for seven days. We had to set up camp by hammering in metal rods in to the ground and propping up the tent. Since it was winter, the ground was frozen solid. Thus, hammering in metal rods felt impossible. After hitting the metal rod with full force twenty times, the metal rod moved about half an inch. And it was common to hit our fingers by accident whilst hammering, and our finger would swell up and turn purple. 

Further, our training schedule was training for 24 hours straight and then sleeping 16 hours and repeating that 3 or 4 times. So by the end of every 24 hours, we would all be insanely tired and would literally doze off while standing. But even worse, we could not get a good night sleep since it was still freezing cold in the sleeping bag, and I would wake up every ten minutes because my toes were cold. To fix this, we put in heating pockets into our sleeping bag near our feet, but then wake up with blisters on our ankles because it would be too hot. Additionally, we had night shifts, where we had to wake up in the middle of the night and stand in front of our tent for securing the perimeter for two hours. Lastly, one of the officers did not turn off his normal six AM alarms and he did not wake up to turn it off when it was ringing so we suffered through that alarm through out the night as well. 

Honestly, it was awful. But having gone through that, I believe I am a stronger person.


Shooting artilleries:

I was in the Artillery base during my service. We had these giant tank looking artilleries that shot 40 kgs shells.

During one of the trainings, we went into the mountains to shoot the artilleries for training. It was in this mud field in between the mountains where each step would get stuck in the mud. While shooting the artilleries, one of my unit memeber got injured. His finger slipped while trying to lift the 40 kg shell and it landed on his finger. He jumped out of the artillery and screamed in pain and fell to the ground. Although a soldier was hurt, we had to continue our scheduled training, especially because a two star general was present in the training. Thus, I had to take his position and do his part. I was frightened by the thought of me making the same mistake and smashing my finger too. Thankfully, this did not happen and everything went well afterwards. However, the injured soldier did injur his tendon in his finger and had to get surgery for it.



## Conclusion

Going through these different events with people built our friendship like nothing else, and I have made my best friends during my service. Although awful, it was still very fun and I am proud to have finished it.
